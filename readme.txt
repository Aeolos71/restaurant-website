I have added functionality to the recipes page. 

From recipes page you can download (not really) a recipe or to like a recipe. When you click on a recipe opens a recipe detail section which includes the buttons to download or like the recipe and the details such as ingredients, or method to cook it.

There is a counter at the top that counts how many times you have downloaded a recipe and how many likes.
